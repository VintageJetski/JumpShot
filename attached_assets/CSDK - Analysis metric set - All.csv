,Spacetaker + Support,Follow-Up Trade Rate (FTR),Evaluates how effectively the Support capitalizes on the Spacetaker’s aggression—either trading the Spacetaker’s death or pushing deeper once the Spacetaker has cleared initial angles.,"- Parse kill and death logs for the Spacetaker. 
- If the Spacetaker dies, see if the Support gets a trade within X seconds at the same location. 
- FTR = (# of trades by Support after Spacetaker death) / (Total Spacetaker deaths in attempt).",,,
,IGL + Lurker,Info-to-Impact Rate (IIR),"Tracks how many times the Lurker’s early intel (enemy positions, rotations) is acted upon by the IGL to secure round advantages—like quick site calls or fakes exploiting uncovered areas.","- Log each piece of Lurker intel (spotting enemies, forced rotations). 
- Check subsequent IGL calls (site hits, rotation shifts). 
- IIR = (# of successful calls leveraging Lurker intel) / (Total Lurker intel events).",,,
,IGL + Lurker,Late-Round Lurk Conversion (LLC),"Reflects how often the IGL times the Lurker’s flank or push with a main team execute, creating a pincer or a backstab that seals the round.","- Identify rounds where the Lurker attempts a flank (timestamp & position). 
- Mark if the IGL’s main force executes the site within ±X seconds. 
- LLC = (# of successful lurk flanks timed with team executes) / (Total lurk flank attempts).",,,
,AWPer + Anchor,Defensive Handover Efficiency (DHE),"Shows how well the AWPer and Anchor coordinate handoffs on CT. For instance, the AWPer holds an angle initially, then transitions responsibility to the Anchor without leaving gaps.","- Track AWPer’s presence on a certain angle or zone. 
-  When the AWPer rotates off, see if the Anchor consistently picks up coverage. 
- DHE = (Rounds where site coverage is seamless between AWPer & Anchor) / (Total transitions).",,,
,AWPer + Anchor,Retake Overwatch Rate (ROR),Assesses how often the AWPer and Anchor successfully pair up in retake scenarios—Anchor leading the charge while the AWPer provides overwatch or picks defenders off key angles.,"- Identify retake situations where both AWPer and Anchor are alive. 
- Check if the AWPer gets kills or forces enemies off angles while the Anchor moves in. 
- ROR = (Successful retakes involving AWPer & Anchor synergy) / (Total retake attempts with both alive).",,,

,,1. Avg. Distance During Engagements (ADDE),"Tracks the average spacing between teammates when firefights occur, ensuring they remain within trade or support range but not too close to risk multi-kills.","1) Identify timestamps and locations of all engagements. 
2) For each pair/trio of teammates, compute distance at engagement time. 
3) ADDE = mean of these distances across the match (ideal range is role-dependent).",,,
,,2. Zone Coverage Overlap (ZCO),Measures how well the team covers the map’s key zones without redundant overlaps or leaving major angles undefended—akin to covering all passing lanes in basketball or hockey.,"1) Divide map into defined zones. 
2) For each round segment (e.g., early/mid/late), see which players hold which zones. 
3) ZCO = (zones adequately covered) / (total critical zones).",,,
,,3. Rotational Path Efficiency (RPE),Evaluates how cleanly and quickly teammates rotate without colliding or wasting time in congested corridors—like good off-ball movement in basketball or line changes in hockey.,"1) Track each player’s path when rotating. 
2) Note collisions (where two players block or slow each other), or dead-time in corners. 
3) RPE = 1 - (penalty points for collisions / total rotations).",,,
,,4. Synchronized Execution Index (SEI),Focuses on T-side alignment: how tightly multiple players converge on a site (in both time and space). Measures the “all-in” synergy of a site execute.,"1) Label the time window (e.g., ±3s) around the first player’s push into site. 
2) Count how many teammates cross the same choke point in that window. 
3) SEI = (# of players entering site simultaneously) / (# expected in the strategy).",,,
,,5. Counter-Rotate Speed (CRS),"For CT side, checks how quickly multiple players reinforce a threatened site, ensuring minimal window for Ts to exploit a lone anchor.","1) Identify anchor “help request” or first sign of T aggression. 
2) Measure how long it takes the next 1–2 CTs to arrive in effective range. 
3) CRS = mean arrival time across relevant rounds (lower is better).",,,
